# CS-360-System-Programming-HW-archieve

This is my archieve of my homeworks for CS 360 System Programming at WSUV Fall 2021.
I decide to make an archive for this class because it's the hardest class I've taken at WSUV but it prepared me everything to take on Embedded Systems Class, which is my favorite one.
Also, I know for sure a lot of people taking this class at the moment is browsing github for these assignments too.
